# What are you doing?
I'm using a data set from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System(NEISS) which collects data from U.S. hospitals about consumer-product related injuries. I'm hoping to create either an interactive webpage or shiny app that contains interesting facts or graphics I obtain from the data. Specifically, I'm looking into what products affect babies the most.
# Why are you doing it?
In the future I would like to work in a hospital/medicinal setting with data/stats related things. I thought this would be a good way to see if I like dealing with "medical" data.
# How are you doing it?
I will have to learn a lot about {distill} or {shiny} in order to succeed. I will then manipulate my data and create graphics throughout the rest of the semester.
# How will you know you are successful?
If I have a functional final project that summarizes the data the way I want I will be happy. If I'm happy, then I'm successful.
